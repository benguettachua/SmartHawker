In addition, a handful of hawkers might not understand the term COGS, maybe a more relatable name could be ""Ingredients Cost"". Lastly, the tax calculation for SmartHawker Expert Testing II Manual (Page 13) hor should be looking at the YA17 one. Cause YA16 is actually referring to income earned in 2015. So if the app is forward looking from 2016, should use the YA17 calculations. Not much difference for small amounts, only last few rows will be affected.
